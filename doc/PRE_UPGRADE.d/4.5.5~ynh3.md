Admin has now more control on what is included in backup.
Before if the backup was made during a download or a import from Radarr/Sonarr, the files was included in the backup causing a significant increase and sometime unecessary backup size.

Now you can go in sabNZB application settings panel in your YunoHost admin panel and select which folders will be backuped.
By default all folders are disabled.

Enjoy 🎉
