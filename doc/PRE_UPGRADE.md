## Before Upgrading SABnzbd

**Important Notes:**

- The upgrade process will temporarily stop the SABnzbd service
- Your configuration and download queue will be preserved
- Downloads in progress may be paused during the upgrade
- The upgrade may take a few minutes to complete

**Backup Recommendation:**
While YunoHost automatically creates a backup before upgrading, you may want to ensure your important downloads are completed before starting the upgrade process.
